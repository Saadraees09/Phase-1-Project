# Opening a Successful Cafe: Business Analysis For Aspiring Cafe Owners 

## OVERVIEW

This project aims to identify the best insights into the Cafe industry using the Yelp API data for existing cafes in the cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco for anyone looking to open a cafe in these two cities.

## BUSINESS PROBLEM

A wealthy group of investors, known as Capital Partners LLC., have been dreaming about opening their own restaurant cafe and have finally decided to begin searching for the right destination. As they have offices in both San Francisco and Los Angeles, the team has narrowed it down to these two locations. They have hired your firm, Data Analysts LLC., to help them better understand each market and ultimately pick the best option of the two. Your team is in charge of exploring which environment will be more profitable through data-driven insights.

## REPOSITORY STRUCTURE

This repository contains a code notebook: yelp_setup.ipynb which contains all code needed to analyze our data. An SQL datatabase (yelp.db) stores all data used for our project. The repository also containsa Readme file: README.md and an images folder for all visualizations and other external images.

## ANALYSIS CRITERIA

For this project, we used four criterias to try to detemine the best location for our cafe:

-Ratings

-Income

-Establishments per capita

-Price

   **MEDIAN INCOME**
Los Angeles and San Francisco may seem to be pretty similar cities in terms of demographics and income, and they are if compared to other cities, but there is still a big disparity of income between these two cities. You may give the credit for that to the the bloated tech industry in the Bay Area. As you can see, the median income in LA is just under $70,000, while the median income in SF is almost a whopping $120,000. That gives us an idea that the buying power is much higher in SF than it is in LA. However, this does not take into consideration the disposeable income of these two cities. Despite of that, San Francisco, with all its expenses and high cost of living, is still the city with the highest disposable income in not just the state of California and the US, but also the world, according to this 2019 NBC news article (https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/san-francisco-unseats-zurich-as-city-with-highest-salaries-and-most-disposable-income/156672/).
 
   **RATINGS**
Our next criteria was to assess the average rating of cafes in these two cities. As you can see, according to the data given to us by Yelp, there is not much difference in how customers rate the establishments in LA and SF. Even though cafes tend to rate better in San Francisco, the difference is negligible. Both tend to rate just slighly over 4 stars, with SF beating LA by a tiny margin.
  
  **CAFES PER CAPITA**
Now this is the part where the difference is just not ignoreable. In this graph, we tried to assess how many cafes there are per capita. We did this to determine where there might be a bigger demand for new cafes and whether or not a market is too saturated for a new comer. According to our data, Los Angeles houses an average of 3.6 cafes for every 10,000 people while San Francisco houses 15.9 cafes for the same amount of people. This may have alot ot do with accessibility. What we mean by that is that since, Los Angeles is a more spread out city, alot of the places require being driven to, while San Francisco is more of a walker friendly city, limiting the ability for its residents to go to places far away and creating more of a demand of similar establishments in a smaller area. That means that even though the San Francisco market is more saturated, that may not be a suffiecient enough reason for a shortage of demand there.
  
  **PRICE**
The biggest motivator for a business is money. Hence, this is one of the most useful graphs for us. We made this graph to help us determine whether a city is resistant to higher priced cafes. What we can gather from here is that there is only one classification of prices where Los Angeles beats San Francisco and that is with low priced cafes. San Francisco is much more welcoming to medium priced, high priced, and exorbitantly priced cafes. Even if we assume that the high number of pricey cafes in SF might be because it has more cafes in general, the fact that LA has more than double the amount of low priced cafes than SF nullifies that assumption. That itself is a huge reason why a business might get attracted to San Francisco.
  
 ## SUMMARY
  
  - Median income is San Francisco is much higher, therefore the residents there do not mind paying for more expensive products.
  - Even though there are more cafes per capita in San Francisco, they have been well abled to maintain their revenue, considering the prices, and have successfully been able to maintain high ratings, even slightly beating cafes in Los Angeles.
